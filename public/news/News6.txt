                                Daily journaling is always the most common topic that people take notes on in a notebook. Journaling can help you improve your literary abilities, better understand yourself, reduce stress, and solve many other problems.

                                Writing something in a notebook is sometimes difficult for some of you, and the starting part is always the hardest part. If you feel like you're incapable of taking a good note of something in your journal, don't feel pressured about it. You can start taking notes on anything that runs through your head, without cooling, without a specific topic, you can even take notes about "sitting around thinking forever with nothing to write about." Remember, this is your diary, it's your private space, you don't need to show anything cool in here, especially when you're just getting started.
                            </p>

                                Once you've written something, the letter automatically flows out naturally. So have the courage to start writing, regardless of everything.

                            <b>I. Identify this as your note.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                One of the biggest difficulties of those of you who want but have never written a notebook is to fear that someone will read your notes, that your notes are stupid, that your real person is not perfect, laughable, that someone will read your secrets,  that a notebook is not safe for keeping too much "personal information that no one wants to know" so...
                                <br><br>
                                A notebook is a highly personal asset, and anyone should understand that reading someone else's notebook without the owner's permission is improper. Whether it's close friends or family members. And if you're worried that they don't understand it, you can make them understand by writing that definition on the first page of your notebook:
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #333333e0 !important;">"This is Sheldon Cooper's property, paid immediately when he picked it up!!!
                                The ban on reading - the ban on viewing - the ban on the dog - forbids the whole idea that I will read the information about the neighboring cat that I write in here.
                                Otherwise it will be a face-off, unfriend, kidnap their beloved pet to bring back as personal property.* Seriously, fuck off*

                            <b>II. Determine that you will write.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>Do you really want to keep a journal, or just want to do something else? If you're determined to keep a journal, buy yourself a pen and notebook for it. You can spend a few hours decorating your notebook with your signature theme.</p>
                            <br>

                            <b>III. Identify what you want to write in your journal.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                As the Webmaster of this website, learning about what users want to read is part of my job, and I noticed that there are about 500 search queries about "what to write in the diary" every month.
                                <br><br>
                                Deciding that you're going to keep a journal can be quite easy, but deciding what to write in a diary is quite difficult, many of you give up at this step because you can't think what you should write in that thick notebook.
                                <br><br>
                                What to write, and how to write is entirely up to you, there are no rules for your diary at all. Here are some common topics for you to start with, you can choose randomly and then type it out if you find it's not right for you:
                                <br><br>
                                1. Fashion<br>

                            <b>IV. Keep a regular journal.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                Once you get used to journaling, you can optionally take notes whenever you want, wherever you're comfortable. But when you're just starting out, set this journal a specific calendar, such as taking notes every night or every morning, taking notes every day or every two days, taking notes at the desk, or somewhere relatively private...
                                <br><br>
                                Once journaling has become your habit, it will no longer be difficult for you. At that point, you can write whenever you want, wherever you feel comfortable, about whatever you like.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <b>V. Time limit for notes.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>You can bring notebooks almost anywhere and take notes as much as unnecessary in your notebook. That can make you "live" in your diary too much, forget about the real world out there, and this is completely unsightly.
                                <br><br>
                                Set a limit for journaling in each of your writings, from 30 minutes to 1 hour is the most appropriate.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <b>VI. Mark the date, month.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                One of the benefits of journaling is that you can look back and evaluate yourself over time. That's why keeping dates on your diary pages is so important.

                            <br><br>
                            <p>There are many of you who do not know what to write on the first page of the diary. Relax and write a nice introduction to yourself. Write about you, write about the things that make you interesting, the things you love, write about your ideals, your dreams, write something about you — who you really are that you've never told anyone before.
                                <br><br>
                                BE AS OPEN AND HONEST AS POSSIBLE, this is the first page of the diary, it can be the inspiration for copying and the subject of your whole diary, and it should be REAL!
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <b>VIII. Consider the diary as the friend you can trust the most.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                Are you wondering how to keep a journal? The best way to do that is to treat taking notes as if you were talking to your best friend, a friend you can trust, and reveal everything in the world. The most important purpose of the diary is still to find a place where you can be honest and straight.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <b>IX. Relax by writing.</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                Never see writing as your burden, always remember to see journaling as a tool for relaxation. It can be a place for you to be creative, a place for you to watch lightning yourself, a place for your thoughts to be free to run and jump. When you start journaling, make sure that the things you take note of are the things you care about and are passionate about.

                                You can take short notes, long notes, maybe specifics, maybe miscellaneous ... But every time you put a pen and note in a notebook, it's called "a note."
                                <br><br>
                                Here are tips to make your "one note" easier.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <b>Brainstorm on the topic you want to take notes on</b>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                Take a moment before taking notes to brainstorm about what you want to take in that record. Set a time of about 5 minutes, identify the topic you want to take notes on, then take notes quickly, very shortly what runs through your head, taking notes continuously until there is nothing left to write or until the time runs out.
                                <br><br>
                                Spend about 3′ more to organize and remove unim significance.
                                <br><br>
                                Based on the ideas you have gained when brainstorming, you will be easier to copy, more coherent and not be hurt.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you're squashed and ignorant, try asking yourself a few questions:
                                <br><br>
                                What did you learn today?<br>
                                Who did you meet today?<br>
                                What's good about doing today?<br>
                                Did anything special happen today?<br>
                                How did you feel today?<br>

                                You can ask different questions, or it's easier to google or pinterest, and search Journal Prompts to use.

                            <p>A note can have many types of them such as title, table, to-do list. You can take notes in the form of an interesting conversation you have with a stranger on the bus, or you wish it would happen. You can take short notes with bulleted tiles, or you can also measure a long text,... Choose the one you find most interesting and then take notes.</p>
                            <br>

                                Don't mold a type of note or use questions for yourself over and over again, be creative and be able to put things together, make the notes in your daily diary interesting, not boring like a planner, but your job is just to fill out the available forms.
